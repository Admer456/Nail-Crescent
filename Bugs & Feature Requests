Bugs

- FUNC_BMODEL Animated texture playback
Animated textures don't play back correctly on func_bmodel. Neither the "ANIMATED" or "ANIMATED FAST" spawnflags work. To be clear,
the animated texture does animate, but seems to be stuck cycling between a few frames.


Features

- Additive Blend Mode Texture support
RTX already supports transparent textures, (trans33 or trans66 surface flag) and seemingly already supports additive blends
with the explosion sprite (alpha_blend_premultiplied?). Would like the option to have a transparent texture that can be additively
blended. The easiest way to go about this might to be add a new "KIND" to the RTX material type flagging system. 

- Sprite spawning:
Currently can only spawn sprites during specific events, i.e. BFG fire/Explosions. Lazarus mod allows for map author defined
spawning of sprites, currently only works in OpenGL.

- Moon rendering: 
We currently can go into "night mode" but there's no moon, therefore no direct light/shadows.
I propose we create a 2nd "sun" that appears during the night with reduced brightness intensity and blue color cast. 
This way map authors can cycle between day or night depending on their needs.

- Ray traced FOG/Volumetric lights
Perhaps code from the volumetric light shaft (god rays) could be repurposed for this. Currently only works on bright sunlight.
