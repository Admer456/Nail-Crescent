- Additive Blend Mode Texture support
RTX already supports transparent textures, (trans33 or trans66 surface flag) and seemingly already supports additive blends
(explosion sprite, could alpha channel be doing this?). Would like the option to have a transparent texture that can be additively
blended. The easiest way to go about this might to be add a new "KIND" to the RTX material type flagging system. 

- Sprite spawning:
Currently can only spawn sprites during specific events, i.e. BFG fire/Explosions. Lazarus mod allows for map author defined
spawning of sprites, currently only works in OpenGL.

- Point light/Light Entity 
RTX can already spawn point lights, but only occurs during specific events, i.e. BFG fire/Explosions. User defined point lights
would be very handy. Another option is to enable support for mapping light entities. https://github.com/NVIDIA/Q2RTX/issues/77

- Moon rendering: 
We currently can go into "night mode" but there's no moon, therefore no direct light/shadows.
I propose we create a 2nd "sun" that appears during the night with reduced brightness intensity and blue color cast. 
This way map authors can cycle between day or night depending on their needs.

- Ray traced FOG/Volumetric lights
Perhaps code from the volumetric light shaft (god rays) could be repurposed for this. Currently only works on bright sunlight.
